    <h2> A Place I Would like to visit </h2>
  
       <p style="color:olive;" style="font family:verdana;" > If I could, I would visit Ireland. I have heard that they have a really
       captivating landscape, and the residents are homely. On my Grandmother's side of 
       the family, there is a family crest and a castle with her last name in Ireland. </p>

    <h2> A Person I Admire </h2>
    
        <br>   </br>
    
       <p class="person description"> I admire Richard the Lionheart. Not only did he retake the Crusader States  
        from the Saracens in the Third Crusade, <span class="important point"> but he managed to defeat the then 
        "invincible" Saladin. </span>   </p>
